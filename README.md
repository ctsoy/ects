- Created classes: Candidate and Pipeline
- Candidate stores name, resume link, start date of entering the pipeline, target position, and source
- Pipeline stores a list of candidates and provides methods to access details of candidates.
- Currently, you can add candidate to list, find candidate by name, and display candidate info in a string.
